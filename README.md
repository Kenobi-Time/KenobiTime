# Kenobi Time

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Kenobi-Time/KenobiTime.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Kenobi-Time/KenobiTime)

This project is inspired by the [Joda Time API](http://www.joda.org/joda-time/) and the [JDK 8 Date and Time API](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/time/package-summary.html).

Actually it's an ported from the OpenJDK source code to Coffee Script.

## Motivation

Since the built-in JavaScript Date API is very limited and libraries like [moment.js](http://momentjs.com) and [Datejs](http://www.datejs.com) are not __feature complete*__, the idea was born to port Joda Time respectively the JDK8 Date API.

## feature complete

* [distinguish between date and time](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/datetime/iso/date.html)
* [time with and without timezone](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/datetime/iso/timezones.html)
